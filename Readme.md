# EventManagement website
 - A dynamic web app in ReactJS like the image below. You need to use MySQL database and django rest framework as backend.
 - The app has register and login page for users.
 - User can create events.Users can add new events: event name, date, time, location and image.
 - Users are able to like and unlike the event by clicking on the ‘heart’ symbol.
 - If the event is liked, the heart color becomes red, else white (for each user the likes corresponding to the event get stored in the DB)
 - There should be 2 tabs at top:
   - Global: Where all events created by any user are visible
   - User Specifc: Only events created by the current logged in user are visible (If no user is logged in, this tab does not visible.)
